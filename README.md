# Rad-Travels

I developed this website through a web development course. The purpose of this project was to design and develop a responsive website while acting as both the client and the developer. 

I created this website by:
- Defining the website's purpose
- Defining the users (created personnas for primary and secondary users)
- Creating wireframes to respresent the content on the website using Adobe XD
- Creating a graphical mock-up of the website using Adobe Photoshop
- Creating a dynamic prototype using Adobe InDesign
- Coding the website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript (Coded pages: Home, Gallery, Contact, Login/Signup)

## Vision
The purpose of the website is to promote a well known travel company called RadTravels. RadTravels sells a new and unique way to experience travel and adventure. The company targets young people in their twenties looking to get away from their daily routine. They try to appeal to people’s sense of adventure. The company offers a variety of options to accommodate the varying needs of clients such as travel length, group size and more. For example, there is an option to book an unknown expedition, which is ideal for more adventurous travellers. The company’s goal is to offer youth an alternative way to travel. They offer an affordable and unique experience, and aspire to give people the trip of a lifetime.
